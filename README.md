# ExplorerShell
## Need to work:
* Download NewShell 2: https://winworldpc.com/download/251a7ccb-86c5-a0c3-8811-c3a4c2ac5a54
* And Inno Setup 2.0.19 (The last that works on NT 3.51): https://jrsoftware.org/download.php/isetup-2.0.19.exe
## Steps:
1. After download both above, first install Inno Setup.
2. Before open the Compiler, download this master brand and put ShellTechnologyPreview.iss and Readme.txt on the same folder as the NewShell 2 Components.
3. So open the Compiler go to *File > Open* and search the folder where you put the ShellTechnologyPreview.iss and open it.
4. After open ShellTechnologyPreview.iss, go to *File > Compile*, and Compile it.
5. Now your file is compile. Install it on Windows NT 3.51, if you install on other system, i will not be responsible for any damage on your system!
## I'm building on:
Windows NT 3.51 /w NewShell 2.
