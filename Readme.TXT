- DO NOT INSTALL IN ANY OTHER OPERATING SYSTEM ABOVE NT 3.51!!!!! -
This project (still) only focus on NT 3.51, if you install this program on other Windows operating system such as (9x, NT4 and beyond), i will not be responsible on any damage on your system!!!

- Installation Notes -
ExplorerShell is a setup provided (yet) a NewShell 2 with customization. This Setup is licensed on BSD License, the files used for setup are copyrighted by Microsoft.

Before you install the program make sure if you installed the last NT 3.51 updates just to avoid any damage on your computer. 

If you installed NewShell (1 or 2), you must first remove their files to install ExplorerShell to avoid corrupting or damaging your system:
1. Locate the original NewShell installation media.
2. Run your cmd and go to the directory that corresponds to your hardware platform (as a example: \NEWSHELL\I386).
3. Type SHUPDATE.CMD /U directly from this location. This command will remove the NewShell functions and reinstall your previous configuration.
4. Now you can install ExplorerShell without problem.
