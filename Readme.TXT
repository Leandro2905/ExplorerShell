Notes about using NewShell "3" on Windows NT 3.51

- DO NOT INSTALL IN ANY OTHER OPERATING SYSTEM ABOVE NT 3.51!!!!! -
This project (still) only focus on NT 3.51, if you install this program on other Windows operating system such as 
(9x, NT4 and beyond), i will not be responsible on any damage on your system!!!

- Installation Notes -
NewShell "3" is a setup provided (for now) a NewShell 2 with a Graphical (and better) Setup. This Setup is based 
on Source-available NewShell 2 setup (shupdate.cmd and shell.inx), but only the Graphical Setup is on BSD License,
the files used for setup are copyrighted by Microsoft.

Before you install the program make sure if you installed the last NT 3.51 updates just to avoid any damage on
your computer. 

If you installed NewShell 1 or 2, you must first remove their files to install NewShell "3" to avoid corrupting
or damaging your system:
1. Locate the original NewShell 1 and 2 installation media.
2. Run your cmd and go to the directory that corresponds to your hardware platform (as a example: \NEWSHELL\I386).
3. Type SHUPDATE.CMD /U directly from this location. This command will remove the NewShell functions and reinstall
your previous configuration.
4. Now you can install NewShell 3 without any problem.

- Reporting Problems -
If you have any problem on NewShell "3", go to my github sourcecode: https://github.com/Leandro2905/ExplorerShell 
and pull a request about that, and thank you for testing my Setup. I Like old computers and systems and this is  
one of my hobby projects.

- This is from NewShell 2 readme.wri -
This update includes a few important bug fixes to problems reported using Office for Windows® 95, NetScape, and
MFC applications on the original Shell Technology Preview.  This release is intended to enable software developers
and vendors to test their applications on both Windows 95 and Windows NT™ version 3.51 platforms.  This release
includes the Windows 95-compatible user interface and shell APIs, but does not include additional applets and other
UI changes such as the fonts and printers folders.  This user interface will be integrated into the base Windows NT
product and made available in a future release of Windows NT.  The date of this release is to be determined.
